## 📦 What's Inside

- **📊 Dummy Data**  
  Pre-loaded data based on the Kaggle dataset:  
  [Enhanced Pizza Sales Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaygaikwad448/pizza-delivery-data-with-enhanced-features/data)

- **🧾 Example Report**  
  A basic report demonstrating how to summarize and present data within Access.

- **📝 Example Form**  
  An interactive form for viewing and editing data from the tables.

- **📁 Switchboard**  
  A simple switchboard (navigation menu) that makes it easy to open forms, reports, and other parts of the app.

## 🛠️ Planned Features

- **Example VBA Function** *(Coming Soon)*  
  A sample function to demonstrate basic VBA usage inside Access — useful for automation, data validation, and other custom logic.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was created to fill a gap — I couldn’t find a solid starter Access project that had:

- Clean structure
- Realistic sample data
- Built-in forms/reports/switches
- A clear path for extending with VBA

So I built this to be a **jumping-off point** for learning, experimenting, and expanding.
