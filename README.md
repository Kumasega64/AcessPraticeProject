# üçï Microsoft Access Practice Template

A beginner-friendly **Microsoft Access (.accdb)** project built as a hands-on practice template. It includes example data, forms, reports, and navigation features.

## Future Plans

- **VBA Function**   
  A sample function to demonstrate basic VBA usage inside Access ‚Äî useful for automation, data validation, and other custom logic.

## Purpose

This project was created to fill a gap since  I couldn‚Äôt find a solid starter Access project that had:

- Clean structure
- Realistic sample data
- Built-in forms/reports/switches
- A clear path for extending with VBA

So I built this to be a **jumping-off point** for learning, experimenting, and expanding.

## Who Is This For?

- Students and beginners learning Access
- Self-taught developers exploring Access for business tools
- Anyone looking for a sandbox environment to test ideas

## üì¨ Contribute
